# CheckMe
Web Application's Class Project

1. As a busy professional, I need to be able to easily schedule and manage appointments with my clients in order to efficiently manage my time and keep my business organized.

2. As a manager, I need to be able to schedule and assign tasks to my team members so that I can track their progress and ensure that projects are completed on time.

3. As a student, I need to be able to schedule my classes and assignments in order to stay on top of my coursework and avoid conflicts.

4. As a healthcare provider, I need to be able to schedule patient appointments and manage their medical records in order to provide efficient and effective care.

5. As a small business owner, I need to be able to schedule appointments, manage customer information, and send reminders in order to provide excellent customer service and increase customer satisfaction.

To address these needs, I will use Spring Boot to create a scheduling software, CheckMe, that allows users to easily schedule and manage appointments, tasks, classes, and patient appointments. I will use MongoDB as the database to store all user information and appointments. The software will include a user-friendly interface, customizable notification settings, and robust reporting features to help users stay organized and manage their time effectively.
